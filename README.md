Project Title

GenoAI: Learning to Predict Genetic Variant Pathogenicity for Affordable Pediatric Precision Medicine

Summary

This project builds a reproducible AI pipeline that predicts whether a single‑nucleotide genetic variant is likely pathogenic or benign, with a focus on pediatric conditions and affordability. Using public genomics resources (e.g., ClinVar and population references), we engineer lightweight features and train baseline machine‑learning models, then upgrade to protein‑aware deep models to improve accuracy and robustness. The outcome is a validated research model, an open‑source codebase, and a small interactive demo that illustrates potential clinical utility (research use only). Emphasis is placed on reproducibility, fair evaluation (to reduce ancestry‑related performance gaps), and low compute cost so the approach can be deployed in resource‑constrained settings. This project seeds a longer‑term PhD and startup roadmap in AI‑driven precision medicine for children.

Problem Statement

Many children lack access to timely genetic interpretation due to cost and specialist scarcity. Existing tools are powerful but often opaque, uneven across ancestries, or compute‑heavy. We aim to prototype a transparent, low‑cost AI approach that delivers competitive accuracy while measuring fairness and deployment feasibility.

Objectives

Data & Pipeline: Build a clean, versioned dataset from public sources (ClinVar ± population references) and a reproducible training pipeline.

Models: Train and compare (a) classic ML baselines and (b) protein‑aware deep models (e.g., using amino‑acid/structure embeddings).

Evaluation: Report AUROC/AUPRC, calibration, and fairness metrics (ancestry proxies where feasible); enforce leak‑free splits by gene/protein.

Accessibility: Benchmark compute/memory to estimate cost per 1k predictions; produce a minimal web demo.

Documentation: Publish a data card, model card, and detailed limitations/ethics notes.

Research Questions

RQ1: Can lightweight models achieve strong pathogenicity discrimination on public pediatric‑relevant variants?

RQ2: Do protein‑aware embeddings significantly improve performance vs. classic features?

RQ3: How calibrated and fair are the predictions across genes/ancestry proxies, and how can we mitigate gaps?

RQ4: What is the practical cost/latency profile for deployment on modest hardware?

Data (Public, No IRB)

Primary: ClinVar variant_summary / VCF (labels: Pathogenic/Likely vs Benign/Likely; exclude VUS).

Optional features: gnomAD summary allele frequencies, conservation scores (phyloP/phastCons), UniProt/AlphaFold metadata.

Splits: Grouped by gene (and/or protein) to reduce information leakage.

Methods

Feature Engineering (v1): Nucleotide one‑hots, chromosome/position transforms, parsed protein change (AA reference/alternate, position).

Baselines: Logistic Regression, Random Forest; stratified and group‑aware validation.

Protein‑Aware Model (v2): Incorporate protein embeddings (e.g., ESM) into a small PyTorch network; ablation to quantify contribution.

Training & Repro: Hydra configs, MLflow tracking, Snakemake/Nextflow (optional), DVC for data versioning.

Explainability & Calibration: SHAP/IG summaries, temperature scaling or isotonic regression.

Evaluation Plan

Metrics: AUROC, AUPRC, F1, Accuracy; Expected Calibration Error (ECE).

Robustness: Performance under alternative splits (by gene/protein), down‑sampling/label noise checks.

Fairness: Report metrics by ancestry proxies (via public population frequency strata) where feasible; analyze parity gaps.

Compute: Latency and memory on CPU; estimate cost per 1k predictions.

Deliverables

Open‑source repo (clean pipeline, configs, README).

Processed dataset artifacts + Data Card.

Trained baseline and protein‑aware models + Model Card.

Short report (6–8 pages) with methods, results, ablations, and limitations.

Minimal web demo (Streamlit/Gradio) labeled “research only.”

Milestones & Timeline (≈8–12 weeks, part‑time)

Weeks 1–2 – Data ingest, cleaning, grouped splits; baseline features.

Weeks 3–4 – Baseline training + calibration; initial report draft.

Weeks 5–7 – Protein embedding integration + deep model; ablations & fairness analysis.

Weeks 8–9 – Cost/latency benchmarks; demo app.

Weeks 10–12 – Polish report, cards, and repo for release or workshop submission.

Risks & Mitigations

Label noise / VUS ambiguity → strict label filters, sensitivity analyses.

Leakage via homologous regions → gene/protein‑grouped splits.

Fairness gaps → parity reports, thresholding strategies, and targeted evaluation.

Overfitting to ClinVar → hold‑out genes; future external validation plan.

Ethics & Compliance

Public, de‑identified data; no human subjects.

Clear documentation of intended use and limitations.

Transparency via model/data cards, explainability, and bias reporting.

Impact

This project demonstrates a feasible path to affordable genomic interpretation with measured fairness and deployment constraints—an essential stepping stone toward pediatric precision medicine at global scale and a strong foundation for your PhD and eventual startup.
